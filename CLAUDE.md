# CLAUDE.md

EF Core 10 database provider that remotes LINQ queries and change-tracking over a wire
protocol. Client `DbContext` has no database; the server executes against a real provider.

## Commands

```powershell
dotnet build InfoCarrier.Core.slnx                       # note: .slnx, not .sln
dotnet test  InfoCarrier.Core.slnx                       # full suite
dotnet test  InfoCarrier.Core.slnx --filter "FullyQualifiedName~NorthwindWhere"
```

Report test results as `Passed: N, Failed: M, Total: T` from actual output — never estimate
or infer a count.

Everything in `eng/` — there is nothing else, and no script does anything a comment in it does
not explain:

| Script | What it is for |
|---|---|
| `eng/measure.sh <label> [baseline]` | The way to measure a change. See below. |
| `eng/ratchet.sh <results.trx> <baseline-file>` | **CI only.** The suite is legitimately red during build-out and tests must not be skipped to force it green, so CI gates on the *direction* of the failure count. It guards the **total** as well: a crashed host reports fewer failures because fewer tests ran, which once came within one measurement of looking like an improvement. Nothing invokes it today — CI is broken (see *Current state*), and fixing CI means wiring this up. |
| `eng/gate.sh` | A detached delay used to schedule an unattended session. Sleeps 7200s, then writes `artifacts/gate-open.txt`. Not part of the build; delete it if it stops being useful. |

**Measuring a change: `eng/measure.sh <label> [baseline]`** (or the `/experiment` skill, which
wraps the whole loop). It prints the count, the exact list of tests fixed and broken, *and* a
diff of the failure **reasons** — three levels, because each one hides a mistake the level below
it catches:

- the count alone cannot tell "fixed 4, broke 4" from "changed nothing";
- the fixed/broken lists alone cannot tell "changed nothing" from "fixed what it aimed at and
  uncovered the next problem in the same tests" — both leave the name list byte-identical. That
  one produced a wrong revert (plan L8) after two runs were read as neutral.

Never state a verdict from partial output. Two specific errors have each cost a wrong revert
here, and both are cheap to avoid:

- **A count that did not move does not mean the target does not exist.** A matcher that never
  fired and a rewrite that did not help look identical from outside. Establish that the code
  *ran* — a probe writing to a file, since xUnit swallows stdout — before concluding anything
  about the problem.
- **A newly-red SQLite test is not automatically a regression.** Grep
  `subrepos/efcore/test/EFCore.Sqlite.FunctionalTests` for the name first: if EF overrides it
  with `ApplyNotSupported`, the query now reaches SQL and this is convergence with the reference
  provider. Adopt EF's override. The reverse also happens — an override of ours that EF does
  *not* have is a workaround to delete once the limitation goes.

## Where authority lives

`docs/` is the source of truth. Read before changing design, and keep it current:

| Doc | Role |
|---|---|
| `docs/decisions.md` | **ADR log.** LOCKED entries are binding. |
| `docs/infocarrier-core-requirements.md` | Authoritative requirements spec |
| `docs/roadmap.md` | **Stable** milestone plan for the whole project |
| `docs/implementation-plan.md` | **Rolling** checkbox detail for the *current* milestone only |
| `docs/architecture.md` | Components, test strategy, open questions |
| `docs/research-findings.md` | EF Core 10 pipeline findings backing the ADRs |

**Roadmap vs plan — do not mix them.** Milestone-level scope, ordering, and exit criteria go
in `roadmap.md`, which changes only when scope changes. Per-task checkboxes go in
`implementation-plan.md`, which is rewritten at each milestone boundary (previous ones land in
`docs/archive/`, never edited again). Putting task detail in the roadmap, or scope changes in
the plan, is what caused the drift these two docs replaced.

**Reversing a LOCKED ADR requires a dated supersession edit in `docs/decisions.md`** — not a
code change that quietly contradicts it. ADR-001 (greenfield serializer, no Remote.Linq/Aqua
dependency), ADR-004 (inherit `EFCore.Specification.Tests`), and ADR-006 (raw capture at
`IDatabase.CompileQuery`) are the ones most likely to be violated by accident.

## Guardrails

**Never edit anything under `subrepos/`.** Those are git-ignored reference clones of
`efcore`, `rlinq`, `aqua`, and `infocarrier-v1`, kept for source-level study. `efcore` is the
authoritative EF Core 10 reference — grep it to confirm API shapes rather than guessing.
Edits there are invisible to git and will be lost.

**Never `[Skip]`, delete, or override a spec test to make the suite green.** The inherited
`EFCore.Specification.Tests` classes *are* the coverage goal (ADR-004); a red test is
information. If a test targets genuinely unimplemented functionality, leave it failing and
note it in `docs/implementation-plan.md`. Silently suppressing tests was v1's stated failure
mode.

**Update the plan checkbox in the same commit as the work.** `docs/implementation-plan.md`
drifted out of sync with git once already (F1–F7 were committed while still shown unchecked).
One substep per commit, message prefixed `Step <id>:`.

**EF1001 warnings are expected and allowed.** This provider legitimately depends on EF Core
internals (`IStateManager`, `EntityQueryable<>`, `InternalEntityEntry`). Do not suppress them
repo-wide and do not refactor to avoid them — but do prefer public API where one exists.

**Do not add a NuGet dependency on Remote.Linq or Aqua** (ADR-001). They are specification
material only.

## Current state

Query, projection split and SaveChanges all work end-to-end. The suite stands at
**`Total tests: 11344, Passed: 11267, Failed: 48, Skipped: 29`** (2026-08-03) across the
Northwind query bases and `GraphUpdatesTestBase`, `PropertyValuesTestBase`, `FindTestBase`,
`LoadTestBase` and `ManyToManyTrackingTestBase` on Tier A, plus `OptimisticConcurrencyTestBase`
on Tier B. `PropertyValues`, `Find`, `ManyToManyTracking` and `OptimisticConcurrency` are
effectively clear; the remaining 48 are 22 query, 22 lazy loading, and 4 singletons.

Lazy loading works (Phase L): it began at 505 of 505 failing and is now 22 of 825 across
`LoadInfoCarrierTest` and `LazyLoadProxyInfoCarrierTest`. Do not read the failure count as a long tail; subtract that family
first.

Not yet implemented, in rough priority order:
- **Lazy loading** — 22 failures left across `Load` and `LazyLoadProxy`. Phase L in
  `docs/implementation-plan.md`.
- **The query residual** — 22, unchanged since Z7 and the largest family left. A true long tail:
  11 distinct methods, each with its own cause (client-eval navigation reads, untranslatable
  subqueries, GroupBy shapes). No shared root cause, so it is individual work.
- **The `GraphUpdates` residual** — 1 of 1787, one parameterization of
  `Save_optional_many_to_one_dependents`. Classified in `docs/implementation-plan.md` under S3c,
  which is read out of `artifacts/measure/` rather than tallied by hand — the table it replaced
  had drifted badly.
- **The remaining spec bases** — the rest of the 138 the compliance test reports unadopted.
- **Transactions** (roadmap M4) — `InfoCarrierTransactionManager` *ignores* them and raises
  `InfoCarrierEventId.TransactionIgnoredWarning` (warning-as-error by default), as EF's
  InMemory provider does. `InProcessInfoCarrierServer`'s three transaction methods throw.
  Needs the wire-protocol W3 transaction token.
- **CI is broken** — `.github/workflows/build.yml` restores `InfoCarrier.Core.sln` (repo has
  `.slnx`), and its `~InMemory` / `~SqlServer` filters match no current test class.

The Tier B store is **file-backed** (`<StoreName>.db` in the test output directory), as EF
Core's own `SqliteTestStore` is. Do not move it back to `Mode=Memory;Cache=Shared`: that makes
the database's lifetime a connection's, which makes test-class disposal order load-bearing and
has already produced a 698-test phantom failure. For the same reason **the store must not delete
its file on disposal, and must not release its `Created` entry either** — either one
reintroduces the coupling. The second half survived S3c-5 and produced a nine-test intermittent
failure once the suite passed ten thousand tests: a shared store's disposal re-armed the guard
and let a later class re-seed the file a live one was still using. `DisposeAsync` now releases
nothing. Stale files are swept once at startup instead.

**The suite is deterministic. Run it once.** Do not re-run to "confirm" a result — `measure.sh`
already ran it, and repeating that is minutes of wall clock buying nothing. Flakiness is not the
default assumption.

**If you do notice flakiness, it becomes the top priority — before whatever you were doing.** The
signal is a run that differs from the previous snapshot with **no code change between them**;
that is the only thing that justifies suspecting it. Stop, find the cause, fix it, and only then
go back to the work. A flake left in place poisons every measurement after it, which is how this
repo lost a day to a 698-test phantom failure and later to a nine-test intermittent one. Verify
the fix with three consecutive identical runs — *that* is what the three-run bar is for, not for
routine work.
