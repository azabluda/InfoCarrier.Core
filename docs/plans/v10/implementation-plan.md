# Implementation plan — post-10.0 work, no milestone open

Milestone-level scope lives in [`roadmap.md`](roadmap.md). Do not put scope here.

**Every milestone closed on 2026-08-24.** M5 was the last, and this file was rewritten because of
it. What follows Phase Q is issue-driven rather than milestone-driven: each section names the GitHub
issue it serves, and **which release the work lands in is not decided here** — the issues carry that,
and it may be a 10.0.x patch or a later minor. Closed milestones are archived and never edited again:

| Milestone | Plan |
|---|---|
| M5 — wire hardening (Phase P) | [`archive/implementation-plan-m5-phase-p.md`](archive/implementation-plan-m5-phase-p.md) |
| M6 — spec-base adoption (Phases A–C) | [`archive/implementation-plan-m6-phase-c.md`](archive/implementation-plan-m6-phase-c.md) |
| M8 — productization (Phases H–N) | [`archive/implementation-plan-m8-phases-h-n.md`](archive/implementation-plan-m8-phases-h-n.md) |
| M9 — provider neutrality (Phase J) | [`archive/implementation-plan-m9-phase-j.md`](archive/implementation-plan-m9-phase-j.md) |

The suite stands at `Total tests: 22662, Passed: 22476, Failed: 9, Skipped: 177`. All nine are
classified in the archived M9 plan and stated for consumers in
[`limitations.md`](../../../website/docs/limitations.md).

## Phase Q — verifying the cancellation path over HTTP

**This is verification of work that already shipped, not a milestone.** Phase P made the server use
the token it was already handed, and proved it with
`InMemorySmokeTest.The_server_stops_a_query_when_the_caller_cancels`. That test replays a request
into the in-process server. **It says nothing about HTTP, which is the only transport a user gets.**

**And a user-facing page already makes the claim.** `guide/errors.md` tells a reader that the token
reaches the server, so cancelling stops the query there. That sentence must not stand on a path
nobody has watched.

**The existing HTTP tests do not use a real web server**, which is the thing worth knowing before
planning any of this. `NorthwindServerFactory` derives from `WebApplicationFactory`, so
`CreateClient()` runs the pipeline in memory: no socket, no port, and Kestrel never runs. Anything
built on that factory tests this repository's wiring and not the web server's behaviour.

- [x] **Q1. Our wiring, on the in-memory host.** `<commit d7f3083 red, 9dc4931 green>` Prove that `MapInfoCarrier` hands
      `HttpContext.RequestAborted` down the chain rather than dropping it, and that
      `HttpInfoCarrierTransport` hands the caller's token to `HttpClient`. Both are this
      repository's own lines, and both are deterministic to assert.
- [x] **Q2. A real Kestrel host: NOT DONE, and not to be done.** Decided 2026-08-24 by the owner.
      The question it would have answered is Microsoft's rather than ours: for a POST request
      Kestrel does not always learn that the client has gone until it writes the response. Answering
      it needs a real socket and a real port, which no test here starts, and it would be the first
      timing-sensitive test in a repository that treats a flaky test as a stop-everything defect.
      **What stands instead is what Q1 measures**: the token reaches the store on the cancellable
      path, which is this repository's whole half of the problem. If Kestrel is ever slow to report
      a lost client, the effect is that cancelling frees the server later than it could, not that
      anything is wrong here.

## Phase R — the compliance gate, and the relational spec inventory (#56)

**Not a milestone.** #56 found that `InfoCarrierComplianceTest`, the test CLAUDE.md calls the current
answer to "which bases are in", could not see a single base in `EFCore.Relational.Specification.Tests`.
`ComplianceTestBase.GetBaseTestClasses` reads its own assembly, which is the core one. The gate was
answering a smaller question than it claimed, and the TPT and TPC gap that prompted the issue was
only a fraction of what it hid.

- [x] **R1. Let the gate see the relational assembly.** `<commit 935adfa>` Inherit EF's
      `RelationalComplianceTestBase`, which ships exactly that override and is what EF's own
      relational providers use. A hand-written override was tried first and deleted as a duplicate.
      `failed` 9 -> 11 and `total` 22667 -> 22668, both recorded in `test/known-failures.txt`:
      `All_test_bases_must_be_implemented` turns red with the true inventory, and
      `All_query_test_fixtures_must_implement_ITestSqlLoggerFactory` arrives as a new test naming 27
      fixtures.
- [x] **R2. Ignore what is server-only, with a reason on each entry.** `IgnoredTestBases` was empty.
      Twelve entries added, each verified against the base's own source rather than its name:
      migrations and design-time scaffolding (4), the two SQL generators, the three ADO.NET
      interception bases, the relational DI registrations, and the three precompiled-query bases,
      which pregenerate a provider's SQL at build time on a client that compiles no SQL. 160 listed
      bases become 148. **The other two "do not adopt" groups in #56 are deliberately still listed**:
      the `RelationalModelBuilderTest` nested bases and the `FromSql`/`ToQueryString` family need a
      relational *client* API, which is #60's decision, and a base that is merely undecided must stay
      visible. Measured: no test moved. 22668 / 22480 / 11 / 177, FIXED none, BROKEN none, REASONS
      unchanged (`issue56-ignored`).
- [ ] **R3. `ITestSqlLoggerFactory` on the query fixtures — a prerequisite for R4, not for #62.**
      This is what the new compliance test asks for, and its 27 fixtures are only reachable once a
      fixture can hand a test the server's SQL through EF's own type. **Note what adopting it
      implies**: EF's relational query bases assert with `AssertSql` against golden strings, which
      pins the *backend's* dialect. `ServerParameterizationTest`'s own remarks argue against golden
      strings for this repository, and that argument has to be answered here rather than skipped —
      a base whose whole content is `AssertSql` is #56's "SQL plumbing only" group.
- [ ] **R4. Classify the remaining 148.** Each is adopt-on-Tier-B, or an ignore entry with a reason.
      #56 carries the hand classification; this step replaces it with an enforced one. The TPT and
      TPC bases that prompted the issue are the first ones worth taking.

## Phase S — the query parameters still inlined as SQL literals (#62)

**Not a milestone.** #59 fixed two shapes of one defect and a sweep counted what survived: 379
inlined substitutions in four categories, of which #62 says "None has been checked against the
server's SQL. Each is a hypothesis."

**No product diagnostic was needed to check them, and #49 was closed for saying otherwise.**
`Sqlite/ServerParameterizationTest.cs` already runs a query twice — over the wire and directly on
the server context — and compares the two statements, with parameter names normalized. The
provenance problem that would justify a counter inside `Substitute` does not exist inside a test,
because the test author wrote the query.

- [x] **S1. Check categories 2 and 3.** `<commit 62527cc>` Four cases. Both hypotheses correct:
      a `HashSet`, an `ImmutableArray` and a `ReadOnlyCollection` reached the store as
      `IN ('alpha', 'gamma')` where the direct query got `IN (@p, @p)`, and `Where(b => b == blog)`
      reached it as `"b"."Id" = 2` where the direct query got `= @p`. Committed red, as Q1 did.
      `failed` 11 -> 15, `total` 22668 -> 22672.
- [x] **S2. Fix category 3, the collection types.** The client's guard asked whether a `List<T>`
      satisfies the declared type. The far side can do more than that: `ConstructCollection` also
      reaches a single-argument constructor, a set interface, a static `CreateRange` and an
      add-to-new loop. The fix asks the rebuilder itself, through a new
      `DynamicValueMapper.CanRebuildCollection`, so the two sides cannot drift — and
      `IOrderedEnumerable<T>` is still refused, because nothing in `ConstructCollection` produces
      one. `failed` 15 -> 12, FIXED the three collection cases, BROKEN none. 22672 / 22483 / 12 /
      177 (`issue62-fix-collections`). Trim ratchet 89 <= 89, unchanged.
- [x] **S3. Fix category 2, the entity constant.** `Substitute` excludes an entity-typed parameter
      because EF expands entity equality into a key comparison itself. The measurement shows the
      expansion then carries a *literal* key: EF reads the key off a `ConstantExpression` eagerly,
      where a member read would have been parameterized. The wire already sends an entity by
      reference and rebuilds it with its key (`MaterializeEntityReference`), which is what makes
      boxing one plausible. It was the change most likely to cost something elsewhere and it cost
      nothing: `failed` 12 -> 11, FIXED the entity case, BROKEN none. 22672 / 22484 / 11 / 177
      (`issue62-fix-entity`). Trim ratchet 89 <= 89, unchanged.
- [x] **S4. Check categories 1 and 4.** Both hypotheses correct, so **all four of #62's categories
      are now checked and all four are real**. A converted struct key reaches the store as
      `"s"."Id" = 7`, and a complex value as `"a"."Address_City" = 'Oslo'`, where the direct query
      gets `@p` in both places. Two entities added to `SqliteSmokeContext` to carry them, as
      `GuidKeyed` was added for #59, and adding them broke nothing. Committed red. `failed` 11 ->
      13, `total` 22672 -> 22674.
- [x] **S5. Fix category 1, the converted struct key.** This is the one #59 tried and backed out
      of: boxing on the declared type alone broke 21 `KeysWithConvertersInfoCarrierTest` tests with
      "Object must implement IConvertible", because the box's value must round-trip and a converted
      key is not a wire primitive. #62's question is whether the value can cross in its *converted*
      form. **Read `known-failures.txt`'s #59 entries before starting**: the first attempt at this
      is written up there and the reason it failed is not obvious from the code. **Done, and
      reproducing #59's failure first is what located the fault**: the box is the problem, not the
      value. `ParameterBox<object>` loses the runtime type, `ParameterBox<BytesStructKey>` does not,
      and that second shape is already green wherever the declared type is the struct. So the key is
      boxed on its runtime type and an `Expression.Convert` restores the node type. `failed` 13 ->
      12, all 21 `KeysWithConverters` tests green. 22674 / 22485 / 12 / 177
      (`issue62-fix-structkey`). Trim ratchet 89 <= 89.
- [x] **S6. Fix category 4, the complex value.** EF splits a complex value into one parameter per
      property; this side sends one constant. Unlike S5 there is no failed attempt on record, and
      the entity fix in S3 is the nearest precedent. **Done. A complex property is not in
      `GetProperties()` but in `GetComplexProperties()`, and the predicate read only the first.**
      The fix broke `Contains_with_nested_and_composed_operators`, which asserted a throw; two
      narrowings failed to restore the throw, and running the base directly showed its own assertion
      passes. So that override was a workaround whose limitation has gone, and it is deleted —
      `website/docs/limitations.md` needs the query added to its "answers where others refuse"
      section. `failed` 12 -> 11. 22674 / 22486 / 11 / 177 (`issue62-fix-complex-full`). Trim
      ratchet 89 <= 89.
- [x] **S7. `limitations.md`: one more query this provider answers and other providers refuse.**
      User-facing, so the humanizer skill ran on the result. The section says three scenarios rather
      than two. The page was ten words over its 700-word budget once the third was added, so the
      pass had to earn them back; it measures 698 and `doc-links.py` passes with anchors.
- [x] **S8. Eight cases pinning where the wire could change the statement's shape.** #62's four
      categories were all found by counting substitutions, and a count only finds a value that was
      already inlined. These come from the other direction: four on the comparison (a null string, a
      `StartsWith` argument, an empty `Contains` list, a value in the projection) and four on
      structure (`Include`, `GroupBy`, `Any` over a navigation, a nullable value type). **All eight
      passed on the first run**, which is the result rather than a disappointment: eight assumptions
      became eight assertions. `failed` unchanged at 11, `total` 22674 -> 22682.
