# Implementation plan — post-10.0 work, no milestone open

Milestone-level scope lives in [`roadmap.md`](roadmap.md). Do not put scope here.

**Every milestone closed on 2026-08-24.** M5 was the last, and this file was rewritten because of
it. What follows Phase Q is issue-driven rather than milestone-driven: each section names the GitHub
issue it serves, and **which release the work lands in is not decided here** — the issues carry that,
and it may be a 10.0.x patch or a later minor. Closed milestones are archived and never edited again:

| Milestone | Plan |
|---|---|
| M5 — wire hardening (Phase P) | [`archive/implementation-plan-m5-phase-p.md`](archive/implementation-plan-m5-phase-p.md) |
| M6 — spec-base adoption (Phases A–C) | [`archive/implementation-plan-m6-phase-c.md`](archive/implementation-plan-m6-phase-c.md) |
| M8 — productization (Phases H–N) | [`archive/implementation-plan-m8-phases-h-n.md`](archive/implementation-plan-m8-phases-h-n.md) |
| M9 — provider neutrality (Phase J) | [`archive/implementation-plan-m9-phase-j.md`](archive/implementation-plan-m9-phase-j.md) |

The suite stands at `Total tests: 22662, Passed: 22476, Failed: 9, Skipped: 177`. All nine are
classified in the archived M9 plan and stated for consumers in
[`limitations.md`](../../../website/docs/limitations.md).

## Phase Q — verifying the cancellation path over HTTP

**This is verification of work that already shipped, not a milestone.** Phase P made the server use
the token it was already handed, and proved it with
`InMemorySmokeTest.The_server_stops_a_query_when_the_caller_cancels`. That test replays a request
into the in-process server. **It says nothing about HTTP, which is the only transport a user gets.**

**And a user-facing page already makes the claim.** `guide/errors.md` tells a reader that the token
reaches the server, so cancelling stops the query there. That sentence must not stand on a path
nobody has watched.

**The existing HTTP tests do not use a real web server**, which is the thing worth knowing before
planning any of this. `NorthwindServerFactory` derives from `WebApplicationFactory`, so
`CreateClient()` runs the pipeline in memory: no socket, no port, and Kestrel never runs. Anything
built on that factory tests this repository's wiring and not the web server's behaviour.

- [x] **Q1. Our wiring, on the in-memory host.** `<commit d7f3083 red, 9dc4931 green>` Prove that `MapInfoCarrier` hands
      `HttpContext.RequestAborted` down the chain rather than dropping it, and that
      `HttpInfoCarrierTransport` hands the caller's token to `HttpClient`. Both are this
      repository's own lines, and both are deterministic to assert.
- [x] **Q2. A real Kestrel host: NOT DONE, and not to be done.** Decided 2026-08-24 by the owner.
      The question it would have answered is Microsoft's rather than ours: for a POST request
      Kestrel does not always learn that the client has gone until it writes the response. Answering
      it needs a real socket and a real port, which no test here starts, and it would be the first
      timing-sensitive test in a repository that treats a flaky test as a stop-everything defect.
      **What stands instead is what Q1 measures**: the token reaches the store on the cancellable
      path, which is this repository's whole half of the problem. If Kestrel is ever slow to report
      a lost client, the effect is that cancelling frees the server later than it could, not that
      anything is wrong here.

## Phase R — the compliance gate, and the relational spec inventory (#56)

**Not a milestone.** #56 found that `InfoCarrierComplianceTest`, the test CLAUDE.md calls the current
answer to "which bases are in", could not see a single base in `EFCore.Relational.Specification.Tests`.
`ComplianceTestBase.GetBaseTestClasses` reads its own assembly, which is the core one. The gate was
answering a smaller question than it claimed, and the TPT and TPC gap that prompted the issue was
only a fraction of what it hid.

- [x] **R1. Let the gate see the relational assembly.** `<commit 935adfa>` Inherit EF's
      `RelationalComplianceTestBase`, which ships exactly that override and is what EF's own
      relational providers use. A hand-written override was tried first and deleted as a duplicate.
      `failed` 9 -> 11 and `total` 22667 -> 22668, both recorded in `test/known-failures.txt`:
      `All_test_bases_must_be_implemented` turns red with the true inventory, and
      `All_query_test_fixtures_must_implement_ITestSqlLoggerFactory` arrives as a new test naming 27
      fixtures.
- [x] **R2. Ignore what is server-only, with a reason on each entry.** `IgnoredTestBases` was empty.
      Twelve entries added, each verified against the base's own source rather than its name:
      migrations and design-time scaffolding (4), the two SQL generators, the three ADO.NET
      interception bases, the relational DI registrations, and the three precompiled-query bases,
      which pregenerate a provider's SQL at build time on a client that compiles no SQL. 160 listed
      bases become 148. **The other two "do not adopt" groups in #56 are deliberately still listed**:
      the `RelationalModelBuilderTest` nested bases and the `FromSql`/`ToQueryString` family need a
      relational *client* API, which is #60's decision, and a base that is merely undecided must stay
      visible. Measured: no test moved. 22668 / 22480 / 11 / 177, FIXED none, BROKEN none, REASONS
      unchanged (`issue56-ignored`).
- [ ] **R3. `ITestSqlLoggerFactory` on the query fixtures — and it is NOT a prerequisite for R4.**
      **Corrected 2026-08-29, after R5 measured it.** This step used to claim two things and both
      were wrong for the family R4 starts with. *It is already satisfied*:
      `InfoCarrierTestStoreFactory.CreateListLoggerFactory` returns a `TestSqlLoggerFactory` rather
      than a bare `ListLoggerFactory`, precisely so the non-virtual `TestSqlLoggerFactory` property
      several spec fixtures expose can cast to it, and `TPTInheritanceQueryFixture` is one of them.
      R5 proves it: 98 tests were collected and run, where a failed cast would have thrown in the
      fixture's constructor and run none. *And there are no golden strings here*:
      `TPTInheritanceQueryTestBase` contains **zero** `AssertSql` calls.
      What remains of this step is real but smaller — the bases whose content genuinely *is*
      `AssertSql` pin the backend's dialect, and #56's "SQL plumbing only" group has to be answered
      rather than skipped. **R4 does not wait on it.**
- [ ] **R4. Classify the remaining 148.** Each is adopt-on-Tier-B, or an ignore entry with a reason.
      #56 carries the hand classification; this step replaces it with an enforced one. The TPT and
      TPC bases that prompted the issue are the first ones worth taking.
- [x] **R5. `TPTInheritanceQueryTestBase` on Tier B, and the client validator it needed.** The first
      TPT coverage in this repository, and the probe that prices the other nine TPT and TPC bases.
      **The probe began at 84 of 98 failing with a single cause**, which is the whole value of
      running it before pricing anything: EF's core `ModelValidator` requires a discriminator on
      every hierarchy, `RelationalModelValidator` overrides that method to allow one without, and
      this provider registered no validator at all. `InfoCarrierModelValidator` lifts the rule,
      with `InMemoryModelValidator` — a non-relational provider subclassing the core validator — as
      the precedent. **The first design keyed on the TPT/TPC mapping-strategy annotation and would
      never have fired**: EF's fixture expresses TPT with `ToTable` per type and never sets that
      annotation. The absence of a discriminator is the signal, as it is in EF's own relational
      validator. 93 of 98 green; the one new red is a real client/server model divergence
      (`Using_from_sql_throws`), left failing per ADR-004 and written up in
      `test/known-failures.txt`. `failed` 11 -> 12, `total` 22682 -> 22780
      (`tpt-model-validator`).
- [x] **R6. `TPCInheritanceQueryTestBase` on Tier B, and what running the sibling proved.** No
      product change: the test class and its fixture are the whole diff, and the figures came back
      **identical to TPT's** — 1 failed, 93 passed, 4 skipped, 98 total, the same test and the same
      reason. That identity is why it was worth adopting before writing anything else. One base
      cannot distinguish a fix for the TPT *mapping* from a fix for TPT's *fixture*; two bases
      reaching the same numbers by the same route can. It also gives the remaining divergence a
      second witness, which is what makes it a defect rather than a curiosity.
      `UseGeneratedKeys` is `false`, copied from EF's own `TPCInheritanceQuerySqliteFixture`:
      TPC needs a key generator shared across tables and SQLite has neither sequences nor HiLo.
      `failed` 12 -> 13, `total` 22780 -> 22878 (`tpc-adopt`).
- [x] **R7. The client keeps the discriminator the server drops.** Core EF gives every hierarchy a
      discriminator; the convention that takes it back for TPT and TPC ships in
      `EFCore.Relational`, which this client does not have. `InfoCarrierHierarchyMappingConvention`
      closes that, registered beside `InfoCarrierValueGenerationConvention`, which exists for the
      identical reason. **Deliberately not a seam**: `IInfoCarrierDocumentMapping` is an interface
      because Cosmos answers *its* question differently, and inheritance is not like that — Cosmos
      always uses a discriminator and has no TPT or TPC, so this convention finds no annotations
      there and is already correct. **The narrowing was the risk**, not the fix: EF compares
      `GetTableName()`, which falls back to the `DbSet` name, so a naive annotation comparison would
      strip the discriminator from plain TPH. BROKEN none across 22879 tests is what says the
      boundary holds. `failed` 13 -> 11, `total` 22878 -> 22879 (`hierarchy-convention`), trim
      ratchet 89 <= 89. **The count is back where it stood before R5**, with 197 more tests.
- [x] **R8. TPH, and the filtered variants of TPT and TPC.** 144 new tests, 141 green. **The two
      filters bases passed on the first run**, which is R7's dividend rather than luck: a global
      filter over a hierarchy must reach every derived type, and under TPT and TPC those live in
      different store objects. **TPH is adopted for the opposite reason** — it is the mapping the
      convention must leave alone, so it asserts the half of the narrowing that must not change.
      Not a duplicate of the Tier A inheritance test, which adopts the *core* base; EF hosts this
      one on SQLite itself. **No TPH filters class**: EF's derives from the core
      `FiltersInheritanceQueryTestBase`, already adopted on Tier A, and one base gets one tier.
      The three reds are ADR-013 — `NormalizeDelimitersInRawString` casts the store to
      `RelationalTestStore` — and all three are raw SQL, so they join #60's blocked set.
      `failed` 11 -> 14, `total` 22879 -> 23023 (`inheritance-family`).
- [x] **R9. Relationships and many-to-many, under TPT and TPC.** Six bases, 1248 new tests, 1236
      green. These navigate *between* hierarchies, so one query touches a derived type, its base and
      the derived types across a navigation. Eight failures were EF's own `ApplyNotSupported`
      convergence and are now green, adopted **after** measuring rather than copied in advance.
      **A filtered probe got this wrong and the full gate caught it**: `~ManyToManyQueryInfoCarrier`
      does not match `ManyToManyNoTrackingQueryInfoCarrier`, so a third of the classes never ran and
      the probe reported 8 where the run found 20. A `~` filter is partial output too.
      **The twelve that remain price #60 for the first time.** All are `_split`; the marker never
      reaches the server, so they run as one query. Eight throw `ApplyNotSupported`; **four do not
      throw at all** and return an over-included graph. #60 argues `AsSplitQuery` changes the plan
      and not the result set — that does not hold here, because the marker vanishes rather than
      being refused, which is evidence for its option 3.
      `failed` 14 -> 26, `total` 23023 -> 24271 (`relationships-manytomany-v2`).
- [x] **R10. Bulk updates over the three inheritance mappings.** Six classes closing **seven**
      entries, 208 new tests, **every one green** — FIXED none, BROKEN none, REASONS unchanged.
      These write, where every inheritance base before them only read.
      **The `UseTransaction` override is on the FIXTURE here, and CLAUDE.md's stated tell would
      have missed it.** `BulkUpdatesAsserter` calls `ExecuteWithStrategyInTransactionAsync` on every
      assertion, but the hook is `InheritanceBulkUpdatesFixtureBase.UseTransaction`, declared
      *abstract on the fixture* — so EF's own SQLite classes override nothing, which reads as
      evidence that no transaction is involved. Inheriting EF's relational implementation would
      have hit `GetDbTransaction()` and the documented 471 `database is locked`. The guardrail
      needs widening: the override may be on the fixture.
      Eight first-probe failures were EF's own `#31402` defect and are adopted as overrides through
      the existing `AssertStoreRefuses` idiom. **No golden strings came with any of it, which
      settles R3 by demonstration**: EF's `AssertSql` lives in the provider subclass, not the base.
      `failed` unchanged at 26, `total` 24271 -> 24479 (`bulkupdates-inheritance`).
- [x] **R11. Table splitting under TPT — the last of the family.** One class closing two entries,
      29 new tests, 23 green. Table splitting merges two entity types into one store object while
      TPT spreads a hierarchy across several, and this base is where they meet. It takes the
      non-shared-model shape, so it uses `NonSharedModelInfoCarrierHarness`.
      **Two reds are ADR-013 in its textbook form and no override can reach them**:
      `TableSplittingTestBase.UseTransaction` calls `GetDbTransaction()` and is *non-virtual*
      (`isVirtual: false`, checked). Only one pair of tests routes through it, so the base costs
      two tests rather than being unreachable — which is why it is adopted rather than skipped.
      **Two reds are topology**: the warning is raised by the relational update pipeline on the
      *server* and asserted against the *client's* logger. Two contexts; the assertion assumes one.
      `failed` 26 -> 30, `total` 24479 -> 24508 (`tpt-tablesplitting`).
      **This closes every TPT and TPC base except the two GearsOfWar ones.**
- [x] **R12. Gears of War under TPT and TPC — the last two, and the largest.** 2354 new tests, 2318
      green. **Every TPT and TPC base EF ships is now adopted.**
      **3419 of 3529 passed before a single override was written.** The 24 distinct failing methods
      were intersected against EF's own 23 SQLite overrides: 15 EF also overrides, 9 it does not.
      **Fifteen were adopted, not twenty-three** — the other eight were never measured red here,
      and copying them would import workarounds for limitations this wire does not reach. 98 fell
      to 36.
      **The 36 that remain are one family, already known.** The base asserts a correlated
      collection with `Distinct` must be *refused*; this provider answers it, because the
      projection split reassembles on the client. That is `limitations.md`'s "answers where others
      refuse" section, which names three today — and one of the nine is **C64** itself, reproduced
      under TPT and TPC. **Whether that page should widen from three named queries to this family
      is a user-facing-docs decision and is not taken here.**
      `failed` 30 -> 66, `total` 24508 -> 26862 (`gearsofwar-tpt-tpc`).
- [ ] **R13. Group C — move the relational bases from Tier A to Tier B.** 83 bases whose *core*
      parent this suite already runs on InMemory, so adopting the relational subclass alongside it
      would be duplication (ADR-009). The owner's policy, 2026-08-29, is to **move**, smallest
      first: 27 add no methods at all, 30 add one to three, 25 add four or more and are held until
      the defects the earlier moves surface are fixed.
- [x] **R13a. PropertyValues, the first move — and it vindicated the policy immediately.**
      `failed` 66 -> 116, **`total` unchanged at 26862**. The same tests existed before; about
      twenty returned `Task.CompletedTask` and the fixture ignored `School` and two `Building`
      properties outright, all because InMemory cannot host complex types. The move added no tests,
      it **made existing ones real**, and 50 fail. **45 are one product defect**: `EF.Property<T>`
      does not survive the wire on the store-values and `Reload` path, thrown on the server.
      `Scalar_store_values_can_be_accessed_as_a_property_dictionary` passed on InMemory and fails
      against a real database — **Tier A was green on a path it never executed.**
      Note for pacing: this base adds *zero* methods, so it is among the cheapest to write.
      Cheap to write is not cheap in reds.
- [x] **R14. Group D classified, and three of its twelve adopted.** The 17 bases outside Group C
      were classified against *measured* properties rather than names. **One is not adoptable**:
      `Update.JsonUpdateTestBase` is the base ADR-013 names — non-virtual `UseTransaction` used by
      136 of its own tests — and the ADR already records the decision. **Four are issue 60**: the
      two `NorthwindSplitInclude` bases, `QueryNoClientEvalTestBase` and `WarningsTestBase`. The
      other twelve are adoptable.
      Three adopted, all green on the first run: `OperatorsQueryTestBase`,
      `OperatorsProceduralQueryTestBase`, `OptionalDependentQueryTestBase`. `failed` unchanged at
      116, `total` 26862 -> 26896 (`groupd-operators`).
      **Three more were written, measured and backed out**: the entity-splitting family returned
      120 failures of 121, 114 of them queries returning zero rows. That is an unseeded store — a
      gap in `NonSharedModelInfoCarrierHarness` for bases that seed data — and ADR-013's rule is
      that wholesale harness failures are not information. They wait on harness work.
      **The distinction that makes ADR-013 usable**: it is not that a non-virtual `UseTransaction`
      disqualifies a base, but that a base failing *wholesale* yields nothing. One use costs a
      test; 136 costs the base.
- [x] **R15. Two more Group C moves — and the policy's second face.** `failed` and `total` both
      **unchanged**, FIXED none, BROKEN none: the signature of a clean tier move.
      `CompositeKeysQueryRelationalTestBase` is the cheapest shape — a one-liner both sides, no
      `UseTransaction`, zero helper uses, both checked. 14 tests.
      **`StoreGeneratedFixupRelationalTestBase` deletes two workarounds rather than adding one.**
      Tier A declared `EnforcesFKs => false` and hand-emptied the store because InMemory has neither
      foreign keys nor rollback. On SQLite both reverse. The base calls the transaction helper
      **118 times and the run is 118 tests, 0 failures** — every one now inside a real transaction
      with foreign keys enforced. `UseTransaction` is `protected virtual` with an empty body,
      verified before writing.
      **Three moves, three different answers**: PropertyValues exposed a 45-test defect (#69),
      StoreGeneratedFixup turned dead paths live and passed, CompositeKeys changed nothing. Only
      the move tells you which — which is the argument for the policy.
- [x] **R16. ComplexTypesTracking moved; ManyToManyTracking examined and deferred.** `failed` and
      `total` unchanged, REASONS unchanged, and the FIXED/BROKEN lists are **the same two tests
      changing namespace** — a rename, not a behaviour change. The two are J22's, unchanged by the
      store. The move deletes two more InMemory accommodations: the post-test reseed and the
      `TransactionIgnoredWarning` log, both meaningless once the transaction is real. Its
      `UseTransaction` override is what makes it real, for the base's three helper uses.
      **`ManyToManyTrackingRelationalTestBase` is deferred with a reason**: its SQLite fixture needs
      store-specific model configuration — `HasDefaultValueSql("CURRENT_TIMESTAMP")`, indexer
      defaults — for `SupportsDatabaseDefaults`. That is server-model work, not a fixture swap.
- [x] **R17. LazyLoadProxy moved — the cheapest move so far, and it found a product defect.**
      `failed` and `total` unchanged at 116 / 26896, FIXED and BROKEN both empty, REASONS unchanged.
      **The move deletes 700 lines and adds 68.** The Tier A class ignored `Milk` and `Culture` on
      twenty-nine entity types, because InMemory has no complex types, and then carried two 680-line
      JSON strings restating the model that was left; the relational base maps both complex
      properties itself, so all of it goes.
      **EF's own SQLite class differs from the core base by one token across both strings** —
      `"Charge": 1.00` becomes `1.0`, because SQLite has no decimal type and the scale that comes
      back is the scale the store wrote. Written as the substitution rather than as 1360 lines of
      duplicated JSON: a base that stops carrying the token fails the assertion rather than silently
      passing, and `Can_serialize_proxies_to_JSON` passing is the proof the scale survives the wire.
      **Four tests failed with `InvalidCastException: Double to Int32`, and it is one defect.**
      `ClientResultMaterializer.Materialize` fills the value buffer by bare property name, and a
      complex leaf's `Name` is bare — `Host.Culture.Rating` is `"Rating"`. `Host.Rating` is a
      `double`; the four `Rating` properties under `Culture` and `Milk` are `int`, and all four
      slots took the double. The file's own remark already warned that a complex value must not ride
      in that dictionary because names collide; **the leak in the other direction, a top-level value
      bleeding *into* complex slots, was not considered.** One condition fixes it: only a property
      whose `DeclaringType is IEntityType` reads from the dictionary, and `ApplyComplexValues`
      writes the complex members afterwards through their CLR member. Trim ratchet 89 <= 89.
      **This is EF's own `InternalEntityEntry` values constructor, copied.** EF only ever calls it
      with dictionaries it controls, so the collision is latent upstream rather than a defect there.

- [x] **R18. Three Northwind bases moved — and the store itself was missing a view.**
      `failed` 116 -> 118, `total` 26896 -> 26900. FIXED none, BROKEN 2, REASONS: the one family,
      34 -> 36. **The four new tests are the relational bases' own and all four pass.**
      `NorthwindSetOperations`, `NorthwindInclude` and `NorthwindKeylessEntities`. The probe went 14
      red to 6, and every step of that reduction is a rule this repository already had:
      **Eight were APPLY.** EF's own `NorthwindIncludeQuerySqliteTest` overrides exactly four
      methods and no others, and the four measured red here are the same four. A query that reaches
      the store and is refused by it is convergence with the reference provider.
      **One was EF issue #21627**, `KeylessEntity_with_nav_defining_query`, where EF's SQLite class
      asserts a `SqliteException`; the store refuses it identically here, arriving wrapped.
      **`KeylessEntity_by_database_view` was OURS, and it was a store gap rather than a query one.**
      `ProductView` maps `ToView("Alphabetical list of products")`, and EF's SQLite suite passes
      only because its Northwind store is a prebuilt `northwind.db` holding the real schema. This
      tier builds its store from the model, and `NorthwindContext` **ignores `Product.CategoryID`**,
      so there was nothing for a view to read. Mapping the column on the server context and writing
      the view as a defining query took 4 red to 40 green. **The client model still ignores the
      column**; a property the client does not know is skipped when the row is read back.
      **The two that remain are the family**, `Collection_projection_before_set_operation_fails`.
      Its sibling `..._after_set_operation_fails_if_distinct` passes, so this provider refuses that
      shape exactly as a relational one does. **That pair is what sharpened the docs wording**: the
      claim is not "collection projections with set operations", it is the *before* shape only.
      The fixture gained `ITestSqlLoggerFactory`, which `RelationalQueryAsserter` casts to on the
      failure path; without it a failing assertion would surface as `InvalidCastException` and hide
      its own reason. Nothing new is constructed for it.
      **`InheritanceRelationshipsQueryRelationalTestBase` was examined and HELD.** Every test it
      adds is `AsSplitQuery`, which is #60's territory and an owner decision.

- [x] **R19. The harness seeding gap, found and fixed — and it was not a seeding gap.**
      `failed` 118 -> 122, `total` 26900 -> 27021. **121 new tests, 117 green.**
      **The earlier reading was wrong.** The note said `NonSharedModelInfoCarrierHarness` does not
      seed. It does. What it did not do is carry the *seeder*:
      `NonSharedModelTestBase.ConfigureOptions` applies `AddOptions` to the **client** context only,
      and `EntitySplittingQueryTestBase` seeds through `AddOptions(...).UseSeeding(...)`. A seeder
      runs inside `EnsureCreated`, and `EnsureCreated` runs on the **server**, so it never fired.
      **Proved before it was fixed**, per CLAUDE.md: the base was adopted, one test run, and it
      answered `Expected: 5, Actual: 0`. After the fix that class is **114 of 114**.
      **Only the seeders cross, not all of `AddOptions`.** The distinction is what the option acts
      on: a seeder acts on the *store*, which is the server's, while warning behavior and
      sensitive-data logging describe how a context behaves and each side owns its own. A29 stands.
      They are read off a throwaway builder because `UseSeeding` has no getter. Passing `AddOptions`
      at all eleven call sites changed nothing else: FIXED empty, and BROKEN is only the four below.
      **Three bases adopted, splitting three ways on ADR-013.**
      `EntitySplittingQueryTestBase`: 114 green, no overrides.
      `NonSharedModelUpdatesTestBase`: **reachable despite the non-virtual `UseTransaction`.** It
      calls `GetDbTransaction()`, but the method that *calls* it,
      `ExecuteWithStrategyInTransactionAsync`, is `protected virtual`; overriding that hands
      `TestHelpers` a different enlistment and never touches the unreachable member.
      **ADR-013's rule is about a base whose ONLY route runs through the non-virtual member**, and
      this refines it. `Principal_and_dependent_roundtrips_with_cycle_breaking` passes because of it.
      `EntitySplittingTestBase`: `Can_roundtrip` green; `ExecuteDelete_throws_for_entity_splitting`
      unreachable, because there the call is inline in the test body with no hook in between.
      **One new finding, filed as #70.** `DbUpdateException.Entries` names every entry the client
      sent rather than the one the store rejected. W5 already documents why the server's entries
      cannot cross; what is missing is the wire carrying *which* failed. Matching by key would not
      fix this case, since all three rows are `Added` with store-generated keys and the server has
      no key for the failing one either. The ordinal in the sent list is what identifies it, which
      makes it a protocol change and so filed rather than taken.

- [ ] **R20. The last four Northwind query bases moved to Tier B.** `NorthwindFunctions`,
      `NorthwindNavigations`, `NorthwindAggregateOperators` and `NorthwindGroupBy` — the Northwind
      query bases R18 did not take. None of the four relational bases adds an `AsSplitQuery` test,
      a `UseTransaction` route or a `RelationalTestStore` cast, so none is gated on #60 or ADR-013:
      each just swaps in `RelationalQueryAsserter` and adds at most a few message-shape overrides.
      The move deletes the InMemory-limitation override sets the Tier A classes carried — one on
      `NorthwindNavigations` (now inherited from the relational base), eight on
      `NorthwindAggregateOperators`, six on `NorthwindGroupBy` — each of which the Tier A class had
      already flagged for deletion once a relational backend landed. Adopted bare; the SQLite
      override subset (EF's own `ApplyNotSupported` / `AssertTranslationFailed` members) is added
      only for what the run measures red. `test/` only, so the gate is `eng/measure.sh`; measured
      on CI's Spec ratchet because a local full run OOMs this box.

## Phase S — the query parameters still inlined as SQL literals (#62)

**Not a milestone.** #59 fixed two shapes of one defect and a sweep counted what survived: 379
inlined substitutions in four categories, of which #62 says "None has been checked against the
server's SQL. Each is a hypothesis."

**No product diagnostic was needed to check them, and #49 was closed for saying otherwise.**
`Sqlite/ServerParameterizationTest.cs` already runs a query twice — over the wire and directly on
the server context — and compares the two statements, with parameter names normalized. The
provenance problem that would justify a counter inside `Substitute` does not exist inside a test,
because the test author wrote the query.

- [x] **S1. Check categories 2 and 3.** `<commit 62527cc>` Four cases. Both hypotheses correct:
      a `HashSet`, an `ImmutableArray` and a `ReadOnlyCollection` reached the store as
      `IN ('alpha', 'gamma')` where the direct query got `IN (@p, @p)`, and `Where(b => b == blog)`
      reached it as `"b"."Id" = 2` where the direct query got `= @p`. Committed red, as Q1 did.
      `failed` 11 -> 15, `total` 22668 -> 22672.
- [x] **S2. Fix category 3, the collection types.** The client's guard asked whether a `List<T>`
      satisfies the declared type. The far side can do more than that: `ConstructCollection` also
      reaches a single-argument constructor, a set interface, a static `CreateRange` and an
      add-to-new loop. The fix asks the rebuilder itself, through a new
      `DynamicValueMapper.CanRebuildCollection`, so the two sides cannot drift — and
      `IOrderedEnumerable<T>` is still refused, because nothing in `ConstructCollection` produces
      one. `failed` 15 -> 12, FIXED the three collection cases, BROKEN none. 22672 / 22483 / 12 /
      177 (`issue62-fix-collections`). Trim ratchet 89 <= 89, unchanged.
- [x] **S3. Fix category 2, the entity constant.** `Substitute` excludes an entity-typed parameter
      because EF expands entity equality into a key comparison itself. The measurement shows the
      expansion then carries a *literal* key: EF reads the key off a `ConstantExpression` eagerly,
      where a member read would have been parameterized. The wire already sends an entity by
      reference and rebuilds it with its key (`MaterializeEntityReference`), which is what makes
      boxing one plausible. It was the change most likely to cost something elsewhere and it cost
      nothing: `failed` 12 -> 11, FIXED the entity case, BROKEN none. 22672 / 22484 / 11 / 177
      (`issue62-fix-entity`). Trim ratchet 89 <= 89, unchanged.
- [x] **S4. Check categories 1 and 4.** Both hypotheses correct, so **all four of #62's categories
      are now checked and all four are real**. A converted struct key reaches the store as
      `"s"."Id" = 7`, and a complex value as `"a"."Address_City" = 'Oslo'`, where the direct query
      gets `@p` in both places. Two entities added to `SqliteSmokeContext` to carry them, as
      `GuidKeyed` was added for #59, and adding them broke nothing. Committed red. `failed` 11 ->
      13, `total` 22672 -> 22674.
- [x] **S5. Fix category 1, the converted struct key.** This is the one #59 tried and backed out
      of: boxing on the declared type alone broke 21 `KeysWithConvertersInfoCarrierTest` tests with
      "Object must implement IConvertible", because the box's value must round-trip and a converted
      key is not a wire primitive. #62's question is whether the value can cross in its *converted*
      form. **Read `known-failures.txt`'s #59 entries before starting**: the first attempt at this
      is written up there and the reason it failed is not obvious from the code. **Done, and
      reproducing #59's failure first is what located the fault**: the box is the problem, not the
      value. `ParameterBox<object>` loses the runtime type, `ParameterBox<BytesStructKey>` does not,
      and that second shape is already green wherever the declared type is the struct. So the key is
      boxed on its runtime type and an `Expression.Convert` restores the node type. `failed` 13 ->
      12, all 21 `KeysWithConverters` tests green. 22674 / 22485 / 12 / 177
      (`issue62-fix-structkey`). Trim ratchet 89 <= 89.
- [x] **S6. Fix category 4, the complex value.** EF splits a complex value into one parameter per
      property; this side sends one constant. Unlike S5 there is no failed attempt on record, and
      the entity fix in S3 is the nearest precedent. **Done. A complex property is not in
      `GetProperties()` but in `GetComplexProperties()`, and the predicate read only the first.**
      The fix broke `Contains_with_nested_and_composed_operators`, which asserted a throw; two
      narrowings failed to restore the throw, and running the base directly showed its own assertion
      passes. So that override was a workaround whose limitation has gone, and it is deleted —
      `website/docs/limitations.md` needs the query added to its "answers where others refuse"
      section. `failed` 12 -> 11. 22674 / 22486 / 11 / 177 (`issue62-fix-complex-full`). Trim
      ratchet 89 <= 89.
- [x] **S7. `limitations.md`: one more query this provider answers and other providers refuse.**
      User-facing, so the humanizer skill ran on the result. The section says three scenarios rather
      than two. The page was ten words over its 700-word budget once the third was added, so the
      pass had to earn them back; it measures 698 and `doc-links.py` passes with anchors.
- [x] **S8. Eight cases pinning where the wire could change the statement's shape.** #62's four
      categories were all found by counting substitutions, and a count only finds a value that was
      already inlined. These come from the other direction: four on the comparison (a null string, a
      `StartsWith` argument, an empty `Contains` list, a value in the projection) and four on
      structure (`Include`, `GroupBy`, `Any` over a navigation, a nullable value type). **All eight
      passed on the first run**, which is the result rather than a disappointment: eight assumptions
      became eight assertions. `failed` unchanged at 11, `total` 22674 -> 22682.

## Phase T — the client model's missing struct complex types (#69)

**Not a milestone.** R13a's move of `PropertyValues` to Tier B made 50 tests real and 45 of them
failed with `EF.Property<T> may only be used within Entity Framework LINQ queries`, raised on the
server. #69 called it "does not survive the wire on the store-values and `Reload` path". It was
not a wire defect: it was a **model** defect on the client, and the wire was faithful.

- [x] **T1. The client type-mapping source claimed every value type as a scalar.**
      `<commit red PENDING, green PENDING>` `InfoCarrierTypeMappingSource.FindMapping` returned a
      mapping for `clrType.IsValueType` unconditionally, so `PropertyDiscoveryConvention` claimed
      the **struct** complex types (`Culture.License`, `Manufacturer.Tog`, `License.Tag`, …) as
      primitive properties before `ComplexPropertyDiscoveryConvention` could see them. The client
      model then lost every nested complex property whose CLR type is a struct while the SQLite
      server's model — whose mapping source returns null for those structs — kept them. On that
      divergence `EntityFinder.BuildProjection`, which `GetDatabaseValues()` and `Reload()` run
      against the **client** model, emitted `EF.Property<TStruct>(complex, "License")` for a value
      the server can only read as a complex type; the server materialised the whole entity and
      client-evaluated the projection into `EF.Property` at shaping. Server SQL confirmed it:
      `SELECT <all 30 Building columns> … WHERE "BuildingId" = @Value` where a working projection
      gives `SELECT "b"."Name"`. **Established before the fix**, as CLAUDE.md requires — the client
      and server complex-type trees were dumped side by side, and the client's was missing `License`
      and `Tog` at every level. The fix maps a value type as a scalar only when EF recognises it as
      one: it has a `JsonValueReaderWriter` (every BCL primitive, `Guid`/`DateTime`/`decimal`/…, and
      every enum) — a plain `struct` does not. Converted struct keys are unaffected:
      `KeysWithConvertersTestBase` configures every one with an explicit
      `Property(e => e.Id).HasConversion(...)`, so it never depends on this source to be classified
      as a property. `failed` 122 -> 72, **`total` unchanged at 27021**. FIXED 50 — the 45 #69
      failures and the 5 sibling `PropertyValues` failures on the current/original-values path (two
      `complex property 'Building.Culture#Culture.License' could not be found`, three
      `Collections differ`) that the same divergence caused. BROKEN none. REASONS: three whole
      classes removed (`45× EF.Property`, `3× Collections differ`, `2× complex property not found`),
      nothing added. Trim ratchet `ours` 89 <= 89, `total` 855, unchanged.
      **Measurement note.** The dev box (8 GB, swap exhausted, an unrelated `ubuntu-desktop-installer`
      snap resident) OOM-killed the test host on every full-suite run, so the suite was run in
      memory-sized `--filter` chunks — a clean partition of the `.csproj`, every chunk completing —
      and the `[FAIL]` names aggregated and diffed against `groupd-entitysplitting`. The count is
      cross-checked two ways (122 baseline minus the 50 fixed; observed fails minus the two
      environment casualties) and both give the same 72 names. The two casualties are
      `NorthwindMiscellaneousQueryInfoCarrierTest.Handle_materialization_properly_when_more_than_two_query_sources_are_involved`
      (sync and async), which throw `System.OutOfMemoryException` serialising this suite's
      known-largest result on a starved box; they pass under normal memory and are not in the
      baseline or the new names file.
