# Implementation plan — no milestone is open

Milestone-level scope lives in [`roadmap.md`](roadmap.md). Do not put scope here.

**Every milestone closed on 2026-08-24.** M5 was the last, and this file was rewritten because of
it. Closed milestones are archived and never edited again:

| Milestone | Plan |
|---|---|
| M5 — wire hardening (Phase P) | [`archive/implementation-plan-m5-phase-p.md`](archive/implementation-plan-m5-phase-p.md) |
| M6 — spec-base adoption (Phases A–C) | [`archive/implementation-plan-m6-phase-c.md`](archive/implementation-plan-m6-phase-c.md) |
| M8 — productization (Phases H–N) | [`archive/implementation-plan-m8-phases-h-n.md`](archive/implementation-plan-m8-phases-h-n.md) |
| M9 — provider neutrality (Phase J) | [`archive/implementation-plan-m9-phase-j.md`](archive/implementation-plan-m9-phase-j.md) |

The suite stands at `Total tests: 22662, Passed: 22476, Failed: 9, Skipped: 177`. All nine are
classified in the archived M9 plan and stated for consumers in
[`limitations.md`](../../../website/docs/limitations.md).

## Phase Q — verifying the cancellation path over HTTP

**This is verification of work that already shipped, not a milestone.** Phase P made the server use
the token it was already handed, and proved it with
`InMemorySmokeTest.The_server_stops_a_query_when_the_caller_cancels`. That test replays a request
into the in-process server. **It says nothing about HTTP, which is the only transport a user gets.**

**And a user-facing page already makes the claim.** `guide/errors.md` tells a reader that the token
reaches the server, so cancelling stops the query there. That sentence must not stand on a path
nobody has watched.

**The existing HTTP tests do not use a real web server**, which is the thing worth knowing before
planning any of this. `NorthwindServerFactory` derives from `WebApplicationFactory`, so
`CreateClient()` runs the pipeline in memory: no socket, no port, and Kestrel never runs. Anything
built on that factory tests this repository's wiring and not the web server's behaviour.

- [ ] **Q1. Our wiring, on the in-memory host.** Prove that `MapInfoCarrier` hands
      `HttpContext.RequestAborted` down the chain rather than dropping it, and that
      `HttpInfoCarrierTransport` hands the caller's token to `HttpClient`. Both are this
      repository's own lines, and both are deterministic to assert.
- [ ] **Q2. The whole path, on a real Kestrel host and a real socket.** The open question is
      Microsoft's, not ours: for a POST request Kestrel does not always learn that the client has
      gone until it writes the response. If it learns late here, the Phase P change helps only the
      in-process transport and the `errors.md` sentence is wrong for every real user.
      **Expect timing risk and design against it**: this repository treats a flaky test as a
      stop-everything defect, so the server side must block on a signal rather than on a sleep.
- [ ] **Q3. If Q2 shows Kestrel does not report the loss in time, correct `errors.md` first**, then
      decide whether anything can be done about it. The documentation must never be ahead of the
      evidence.
